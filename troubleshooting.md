## Build-Time (Compilation) Errors

These errors occur when you run `cargo build` or `cargo run`. They almost always indicate a missing system dependency.

### Error: `linker 'cc' not found`

-   **Cause:** Cargo cannot find a C/C++ compiler on your system. Rust crates with C/C++ dependencies need this to link everything together.
-   **Solution:** Install the standard build toolchain for your OS.
    -   **Debian/Ubuntu:** `sudo apt-get install build-essential`
    -   **macOS:** `xcode-select --install`
    -   **Windows:** Install "Build Tools for Visual Studio" with the "Desktop development with C++" workload.

### Error: `The system library 'lept' required by crate 'leptonica-sys' was not found`

-   **Cause:** The Tesseract OCR engine depends on the Leptonica image processing library. The development headers for this library are missing.
-   **Solution:** Install the Leptonica development package.
    -   **Debian/Ubuntu:** `sudo apt-get install libleptonica-dev`

### Error: `fatal error: 'stddef.h' file not found`

-   **Cause:** This error occurs while building `leptonica-sys` or `tesseract-sys`. The `bindgen` tool, which generates Rust code from C headers, requires the Clang compiler's libraries and headers to work correctly.
-   **Solution:** Install the Clang development package.
    -   **Debian/Ubuntu:** `sudo apt-get install libclang-dev clang`

### Error: `The system library 'tesseract' required by crate 'tesseract-sys' was not found`

-   **Cause:** The development headers for the main Tesseract library are missing.
-   **Solution:** Install the Tesseract development package.
    -   **Debian/Ubuntu:** `sudo apt-get install libtesseract-dev`

### Error: `E: Unable to locate package libpdfium-dev`

-   **Cause:** The PDFium library used for rendering PDFs is not available in standard system repositories like `apt`.
-   **Solution:** Do not try to install it manually. Instead, use the `bundle` feature in `Cargo.toml` to have the build script download and compile PDFium for you automatically.
    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    pdfium-render = { version = "0.8.35", features = ["pdfium-bindings/bundle"] }
    ```

### Error: `mismatched types`, `method not found`, or `module is private`

-   **Cause:** A dependency crate (like `pdfium-render`) has been updated to a new version with breaking API changes. Your `main.rs` code is written for an older version.
-   **Solution:** This is a normal part of software development. You must update your code to match the new API.
    1.  Read the compiler errors carefullyâ€”they are your best guide.
    2.  Check the crate's documentation on [crates.io](https://crates.io/) or its repository for a changelog or updated examples.
    3.  The `Cargo.lock` file is designed to prevent this by locking dependencies to specific versions. If you run `cargo update`, you may pull in breaking changes.

## Run-Time Errors

These errors occur after the project has successfully compiled and you are running the executable (e.g., `cargo run --release -- my_doc.pdf`).

### Error: `Error opening data file ... eng.traineddata`

-   **Cause:** The program is running, but the Tesseract engine cannot find the language data files it needs to perform OCR.
-   **Solution:** Install the Tesseract language packs for your system.
    -   **Debian/Ubuntu:** `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr-eng` (for English) or `tesseract-ocr-all` (for all languages).

### Warning: `Invalid resolution 1 dpi. Using 70 instead.`

-   **Cause:** The intermediate TIFF image saved to disk does not contain DPI metadata. Tesseract sees this, warns you, and falls back to a very low default resolution (70 DPI), which harms OCR accuracy.
-   **Solution:** Do not worry about the image metadata. Instead, explicitly tell Tesseract what resolution to expect using the `user_defined_dpi` variable. In `extract_text_from_image`, add `.set_variable("user_defined_dpi", "300")` to your Tesseract command chain.

### Error: `Failed to load PDF file` or the program is `Killed`

-   **Cause:** The input PDF file itself is the problem. This can be due to:
    1.  **Corruption:** The file is damaged. Try opening it in a standard PDF viewer.
    2.  **Encryption:** The file is password-protected. This tool does not support encrypted PDFs.
    3.  **Out of Memory:** The PDF page is extremely large or complex, causing the rendering engine to exhaust system memory and crash.
-   **Solution:** Verify the integrity and security settings of your input PDF. If it's a memory issue, try running the tool on a machine with more RAM.
